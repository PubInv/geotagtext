# geotagtext
Experimental repo to build maps based on geotagged photos indicating text


## Basic Idea

Eventually, we want an app that lets you locate books in a Little Library. However, the repo is a simple precursor that just lets 
you take photos, which may contain text, and put the location of those photos on a map.

We may begin with a responsive website rather than a native app.

This is a completely free project of Public Invention release under the GPL 3.0. Contact me if you would like to volunteer.
