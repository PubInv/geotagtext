(here)[https://pubinv.github.io/geotagtext/]
## Basic Idea

The goal of this project is to allow a group of people, perhaps in an emegency situation, to geotag locations
to be on a map.

Imagine using your phone to place a red tag on a flooded area, or where a person needs help, and
green tag on a road which is passable.

## Basic Technology

Browser based, free software, using cheap cloud database.

## Goals

 The goal is to further enhance and build on the existing application thereby developing an application user interface or a   public API which can used and incorporated into existing applications or a brand new project for example during natural disaster or in applications like Free Little Libraries or Free Little Food Pantries 


## Agile Development

## History

Begun by Neil Martis and Rob Read.
